    		<p>The RTCSA conference series (now at its 26th edition) brings together researchers and developers from academia and industry for advancing the <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>theory</strong> to design and develop <strong>time-sensitive</strong> applications. The primary purpose of the student session is to provide students with an opportunity to discuss their ideas and gather feedback from conference participants. Students can present their preliminary work on real-time systems,CPS,IoT,embedded systems,fog/edge/cloud computing. Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/" target="_blank">DBLP</a>.</p>

    		<h3>COVID-19</h3>
    		<p>
    			The diffusion of COVID-19 (“coronavirus”) is constantly monitored by the conference organizers. Based on <a href="https://www.who.int/"> World Health Organization</a> (WHO) information, the number of new reported infections is now decreasing in Korea (source: <a href="https://www.who.int/redirect-pages/page/novel-coronavirus-(covid-19)-situation-dashboard"> https://www.who.int/redirect-pages/page/novel-coronavirus-(covid-19)-situation-dashboard</a>). For this reason, we expect a positive evolution by August. Since safety of participants is of paramount importance to the organizers, would the infection pose a threat to participants according to the WHO, we will allow speakers the remote presentation via a video-conferencing system.</p>
