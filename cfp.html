    		<p>The RTCSA conference series (now at its 26th edition) brings together researchers and developers from academia and industry for advancing the <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>theory</strong> to design and develop <strong>time-sensitive</strong> applications. All traditional applications in which temporal aspects need to be considered are in the scope of the conference. <strong>CPS</strong>, <strong>(Industrial) IoT</strong>, <strong>embedded systems</strong>, <strong>fog/edge/cloud computing</strong> are just notable examples. RTCSA welcomes both research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems. Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/" target="_blank">DBLP</a>.</p>

    		<p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. RTCSA 2020 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

    		<h3>Topic of Interest</h3>
    		<p>The 26th edition of RTCSA will bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry to promote cross-fertilization and discuss advances and trends in the technology of embedded and real-time systems and their emerging applications, including the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. RTCSA 2020 seeks papers that describe original research in the following areas, but are not limited to:</p>

    		<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe <strong>original</strong> work <strong>not previously published</strong> and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:</p>

    		<ul>
    			<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Full Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 10 pages</li>
    			<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Short Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 6 pages</li>
    		</ul>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">Both types of submission must be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-columns, single-space, 10pt) and <strong>must include references and acknowledgements within the page limit</strong>.</p>

    		<p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/" target="_blank">DBLP</a>.</p>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">By  submitting a  paper, authors  implicitly agree  that at least one author will register at full registration rate to  the conference and present the paper (in person or via a teleconferencing system).</p>

    		<h3>COVID-19</h3>
    		<p>
    			The diffusion of COVID-19 (“coronavirus”) is constantly monitored by the conference organizers. Based on <a href="https://www.who.int/"> World Health Organization</a> (WHO) information, the number of new reported infections is now decreasing in Korea (source: <a href="https://www.who.int/redirect-pages/page/novel-coronavirus-(covid-19)-situation-dashboard"> https://www.who.int/redirect-pages/page/novel-coronavirus-(covid-19)-situation-dashboard</a>). For this reason, we expect a positive evolution by August. Since safety of participants is of paramount importance to the organizers, would the infection pose a threat to participants according to the WHO, we will allow speakers the remote presentation via a video-conferencing system.</p>
